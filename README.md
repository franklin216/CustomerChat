# Customer Chat

A small Backend Chat from Customer Service to Customer (Frontend) over Websockets

In this example the Customer Service is simulated by a thread which answers the oldest question in a list of Customer questions and waits for 3500 ms to go on with the next one. 

The customer Code (Frontend) is located in main/resources/index.html
